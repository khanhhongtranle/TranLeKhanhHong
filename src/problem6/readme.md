## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1. View the top 10 userâ€™s scores

We need an API GET /top-scores which:
- returns data of top 10 users, sort by score.
- an open API, do not required to login.

#### 3.1.2. The score board will be live updated

We use a socket to handle this feature. In NodeJS, we use SocketIO. The socket emits an event when user's scores are updated.

Front-end side listens socket event and then call API to get new top 10 list.

#### 3.1.3. User can login

APIs needed:
- POST /login API accepts data of username and password, then returns JWT tokens including access token and refresh token if login successfully, otherwise returns 401 error.
- POST /refresh-token API returns new access token.

#### 3.1.4. User can perform an action
Authorized user can perform an action on website, then that user's score will be increased.

API needs POST /do-action API:
- This API is protected, we need provide valid access token to perform it.
- Increases user's score.
- Emit an event on socket, this event means user's scores were updated.
- Return 200 code when successfully, return 401 error if access token is invalid.
